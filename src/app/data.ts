The data indicates a significant decline in adolescent fertility rates in regions such as Australia and New Zealand (from 20.0 in 2000 to 15.8 in 2015) and Europe and North America (from 28.7 to 16.8). However, in regions like East and Southeast Asia, the rate increased slightly from 19.0 to 21.0. South Asia shows a notable decline from 70.0 to 33.3, while North Africa and West Asia also decreased from 50.7 to 42.2. In Oceania, the rate fell from 60.6 to 49.9, and Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from 81.1 to 64.1. Data for Sub-Saharan Africa is not available. This dataset highlights the varying trends in adolescent fertility rates across regions and emphasizes the need for continued efforts to address reproductive health and education for young girls.',
